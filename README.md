This project was made with Spring Boot(version 3.0.1). My purpose with this repository was to check out some of the recent changes of the new release, to stay up-to-date.

I created a REST API which includes users with different roles, also resources(stories).
User services are mostly available for admin(s).
There are different type of stories, some of them are available for all users, while others are only available for users with specific roles.The Roles are the following: USER, VIP, ADMIN.

There are 2 controllers, responsible for the user and story resources. Their names describe what they are for.
